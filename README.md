Current plan is to create or find libraries, that finds these factors:<br />
Relative strength Index using sector rotation<br/>
~~Price history~~<br/>
Market Sentiment (FT, Globe and mail, Bloomberg, CNBC, Reuters, Yahoo finance)<br/>
~~50 day, 200 day simple moving average (SMA)~~<br/>
~~9, 20, 50 exponential moving average (EMA)<br/>~~
~~stochastic oscillator<br/>~~
~~average true range <br/>~~
Then normalize the data,<br/>
Then implement, test, improve and iterate upon the model.
