Current plan is to create or find libraries, that finds these factors:<br />
Relative strength Index using sector rotation<br />
~~Price history~~
Market Sentiment (FT, Globe and mail, Bloomberg, CNBC, Reuters, Yahoo finance)
~~50 day, 200 day simple moving average (SMA)~~
9, 20, 50 exponential moving average (EMA)
stochastic oscillator
average true range

Price history<br />
Market Sentiment (FT, Globe and mail, Bloomberg, CNBC, Reuters, Yahoo finance)<br />
50 day <br />
200 day simple moving average (SMA)<br />
9, 20, 50 exponential moving average (EMA)<br />
stochastic oscillator<br />
average true range<br />
<br />
Then normalize the data,
Then implement, test, improve and iterate upon the model.
